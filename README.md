##Overview

**Squash 'Em** was created as my first project for a Web Development Course in London. It was built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript/jQuery.

The game can be played here: [Squash 'Em](https://quiet-ocean-43961.herokuapp.com/).

##How To Play

Squash 'Em is modelled on a Whack-A-Mole game, where the object of the game is to hit the faces of Drake and Taylor Swift with a tomato splat in order to win enough points within the timeframe to get to the next level. Hitting the wrong face (Rihanna) will result in minus points. As you go up a level, the speed and the number of points needed to win increases.

##JavaScript/jQuery Overview

I used HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery to build this game. After two weeks of learning, I wanted to make something that would be a bit of fun, yet would also require me to think in a logical way and solve problems. 

I began by writing thorough pseudocode to plan each step of the game. I pair programmed for most of the logic, and then put my own spin on it with the styling, images and audio.

I built a 3x3 grid and set images to pop up at random into the sqares, using Math.Random, with those images worth higher points set to appear less than the standard point images, iterating over a variety of speeds in an array.


###Challenges & Wins

The greatest challenge was implementing new levels and resetting the board. Once I worked out how to clear the board and iterate over the next version of the game, with increased speed and decreased time, I felt a great sense of achievement.

It took a while to work out how to overlay the instructions section over the game board. I was very pleased when I managed to implement this, as it made the game feel more complete. This was my first styling win, and set alight my continued passion for all things CSS, design and UX. I used Palletton and Coolers to choose and set the colour scheme, and spent a lot of time playing with what would be aethetically pleasing but still playful.

###Further Development
I would love to add some CSS animation to the game, just to increase the level of fun and silliness.


###Credits
Many thanks to my course instructors Alex and Rane for their help and advice on this project.

###Sound
I used Drake and Kanye West soundbites. If - for any reason - the owner of any of the pieces of content so wishes, I am very happy to edit the game accordingly.
